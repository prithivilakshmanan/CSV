# CVE-2024-55509: SQL Injection in CodeAstro Complaint Management System v1.0

## Description
An SQL injection vulnerability exists in the CodeAstro Complaint Management System v1.0, specifically in the `id` parameter of the `delete.php` component. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query via the `id` parameter. If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the entire database.

## Steps to Reproduce (PoC)

1. Access the directory listing at `http://localhost/admin/` to locate the `delete.php` endpoint.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost/admin/delete.php?id=<user-id>` and manipulate the `id` parameter with SQL injection payloads (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`).
3. Observe the application's response for errors or unintended database interactions.
4. Use automated tools such as Burp Suite or sqlmap to confirm that the `id` parameter is not sanitized properly and is vulnerable to SQL injection.

## Impact

- **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data leakage, privilege escalation, or full database compromise.
